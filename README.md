# Data_collection_of_2603298
We organize the data collected from the internet or papers into multiple documents or tables, and we collect this data in a GitHub repository we created for the judges to review.
Among these files, “Parameter table (1).xlsx” is the list of mobile phone parameters we compiled and calculated. “Validation Results.xlsx” contains the data obtained through model inversion. “B0005.mat” is the NASA dataset used for plotting, while the remaining files are the code used for plotting.
